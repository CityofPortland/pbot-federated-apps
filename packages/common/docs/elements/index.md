# Elements

Elements are the smallest building blocks for our UI. They typically output a single element. They are meant to provide thematically consistent basics that can be combined into higher-order components.

The most basic element is the [Box](./box.md) which wraps the color pallete into accessibility compliant color combinations.

Other elements include a refactored anchor element and input elements.
