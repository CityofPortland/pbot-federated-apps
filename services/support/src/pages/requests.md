#### Data Issue

Data issues include concerns about data privacy, problems with reporting using bureau data, identification of data quality problems that need to be addressed, or other data-related questions. **Reporting data issues does not require Division Manager or Group Director authorization.**

#### Existing Technology Enhancement

An enhancement to PBOT-supported applications (like Maximo, Amanda, PUDL, eBuilder, or GIS) you are using today to meet a process or need that the application can currently support.

#### New Technology Request

If you think that your work requires new software or digital hardware, then make a new technology request and we’ll help identify an existing city solution that meets your needs or help you acquire a new technology to do the job.

#### Performance Support

Support for designing and refining performance metrics and program evaluation strategies.

#### Process Support

Support for developing or redesigning business processes including process discovery, mapping, improvement, and optimization.
