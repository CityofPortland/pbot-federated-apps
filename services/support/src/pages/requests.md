# Request Submission

This page provides guidance on submitting different types of requests to ensure your needs are addressed efficiently. All types of requests are handled through the [ServiceNow portal](https://portland.service-now.com/sp) and this page will help guide you to the appropriate category of request to help PBOT Technology Services efficiently fulfill your request.

## Types of Requests

### Incident

An incident refers to an unplanned disruption or degradation of an IT service, such as a system outage or hardware failure, that requires immediate attention to restore normal operations.

**Submit an incident if:**

- Something is broken or malfunctioning
- You need immediate assistance

**Target Response Time:**

Within 3 business days of receiving the ticket.

### Request

A request is typically a planned action or inquiry, such as requesting software access, initiating an application improvement project, or gathering information about available services. Requests are proactive and generally less urgent than incidents. If a request has an estimated completion time greater than a couple of hours, it will be transitioned to the PBOT Tech Services project tracking platform, and you will be notified.

**Submit a request if:**

- You need access to an application or need something installed
- Initiate a new technology enhancement or project request
- Initiate a new software request
- Initiate software procurement/renewal
- You want to schedule training for a software
- You’ve noticed a technology issue, but it isn’t critical

**Target Response Time:**

Within 7 business days of receiving the ticket.
