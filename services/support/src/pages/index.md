## Staff That Work with Data, Technology, and Process

What is the difference between Strategy, Data, and Performance Division (SDP), PBOT Technology Services Division (TSD), and Bureau of Technology Services (BTS)? What is my role in data, process, or technology improvement?

We are working on putting together some clarifying information and to start we have added [team descriptions](./team). If you have suggestions on helpful information to include or questions you would like to see answered, submit a project support request [here](./requests)!

## Internal Support Request Routing at PBOT

Here is a process overview of how PBOT support requests for data, performance, process, and technology projects are reviewed by the Strategy, Data, and Performance and Technology Services teams

The third stage, refine, is represented by clipart of a head with a thought bubble over a blue circle. The text beneath it reads "If additional information is required, SDP or TSD will contact you." The final stage, route, is represented by clipart of a file inbox with a check mark over a gray circle.

### Submit

Submit your project, consultation, idea, or enhancement request. [Submit your request](./requests)

### Review

The Strategy, Data, and Performance and Technology Services divisions will review the request, evaluate the effort, and determine next steps for the request.

### Refine

Any additional information needed to be able to evaluate and reroute the request is identified. If additional information is needed from you, a member of the Strategy, Data, and Performance or Technology Services division will follow up.

### Route

The next steps are determined for the support request and a member of the Strategy, Data, and Performance or Technology Services division follows up with you to share the feedback of the evaluation, provides resources if applicable, and engage with you on what’s coming up.

#### Process Notes

- An analyst will follow up with next steps within two to four business weeks.

- Support requests made to Strategy, Data, Performance, and Technology teams must be reviewed and authorized by the requestor’s Division Manager or Group Director. Data issues are an exception and do not require authorization.

- No action will be taken on requests submitted without Division Manager or Group Director authorization (Data issues excluded).

- If your request involves purchasing of any kind, please evaluate with management what budget exists for this request or if a budget request will be needed.

- Software outside of BTS standards will likely require an exception. This will add time to request processing prior to implementation. ([BTS Standards](https://www.portland.gov/omf/bts/org-and-principles/standards-and-strategies))
