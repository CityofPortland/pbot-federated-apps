# Welcome to PBOT Solutions Operations Support

To help streamline requesting help for an issue or project, the Strategy, Data, and Performance and Technology Services Divisions have collaborated to put together a single form for requesting operations support at PBOT. This site is designed to help clarify the types of requests, who works on them, and guide you to the right form to address your support need.

Support Types:

- Data Issue
- Existing Technology Enhancement
- General Support
- GIS
- New Technology Request (Request for Proposals)
- Performance Support (designing, thinking through performance metrics and program evaluation strategies)
- Process Support (discovery, mapping, improvement, optimization)
- Training Needs

[Submit your support request](./requests)

## Staff That Work with Data, Technology, and Process 

What is the difference between Strategy, Data, and Performance Division (SDP), PBOT Technology Services Division (TSD), and Bureau of Technology Services (BTS)? What is my role in data, process, or technology improvement?

We are working on putting together some clarifying information and to start we have added team descriptions which you can check out [here](./team).

## Internal Support Request Routing at PBOT

Here is a process overview of how PBOT support requests for data, performance, process, and technology projects are reviewed by the Strategy, Data, and Performance and Technology Services teams

The text beneath it reads "You submit support request." The second stage, review, is represent by clipart of three upper torsos with a shared speech bubble over an orange circle. The text beneath it reads "PBOT Strategy, Data, and Performance (SDP) and Technology Services (TSD) Divisions jointly review request." The third stage, refine, is represented by clipart of a head with a thought bubble over a blue circle. The text beneath it reads "If additional information is required, SDP or TSD will contact you." The final stage, route, is represented by clipart of a file inbox with a check mark over a gray circle. The text beneath it reads "Upon completion of the request evaluation, a decision will be made as to request handling, and additional guidance will be provided to you."](/img/timeline.png 'PBOT Solutions Operations Support requet timeline')

### Submit

Submit your project, consultation, idea, or enhancement request via the [appropriate form](./requests).

### Review

The Strategy, Data, and Performance and Technology Services divisions will review the request, evaluate the effort, and determine next steps for the request.

### Refine

Any additional information needed to be able to evaluate and reroute the request is identified. If additional information is needed from you, a member of the Strategy, Data, and Performance or Technology Services division will follow up.

### Route

The next steps are determined for the support request and a member of the Strategy, Data, and Performance or Technology Services division follows up with you to share the feedback of the evaluation, provides resources if applicable, and engage with you on what’s coming up.

#### Process Notes

- An analyst will follow up with next steps within two to four business weeks.

- Support requests made to Strategy, Data, Performance, and Technology teams must be reviewed and authorized by the requestor’s Division Manager or Group Director. Data issues are an exception and do not require authorization.

- No action will be taken on requests submitted without Division Manager or Group Director authorization (Data issues excluded).

- If your request involves purchasing of any kind, please evaluate with management what budget exists for this request or if a budget request will be needed.

- Software outside of BTS standards will likely require an exception. This will add time to request processing prior to implementation. ([BTS Standards](https://www.portland.gov/omf/bts/org-and-principles/standards-and-strategies))
